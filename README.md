Steadii is an iOS app under development by iiStudio in Fall 2019 for CMPT 275.

Steadii assists predominantly users diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease.
It attempts to quantify a user's short-term cognitive abilities and 
trend of hand tremors for their medical professionals and/or caretakers.

For version I:
While in the simulator, if the login is pressed in the login page, 
the user will be redirected to the caretaker's view. 
In order to access a player's view, tap the following buttons in the following sequence:
create a new account > create my account.
The Word game is not currently constructed and should not do anything. 
The ball game should be fully functional and end when the ball goes outside the plane.
Furthermore, after the ball game ends, the user can only exit the game and be redirected to the main menu.

Hope you have fun!

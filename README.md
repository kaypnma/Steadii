Steadii is an iOS app under development by iiStudio in Fall 2019 for CMPT 275.

Steadii assists predominantly users diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease.
It attempts to quantify a user's short-term cognitive abilities and 
trend of hand tremors for their medical professionals and/or caretakers.



For Version I:

While in the simulator, if the login is pressed in the login page, 
the user will be redirected to the caretaker's view. 
In order to access a player's view, tap the following buttons in this sequence from the log-in screen:

create a new account > create my account.

The Word game is not currently constructed and should not do anything. 
The Ball game should be fully functional and end when the ball goes outside the plane.
Furthermore, after the ball game ends, the user can only exit the game and be redirected to the main menu.



For Version II:

Besides the buttons in settings, the app should be fully functional in the player's view.
In order to access a player's view, tap the following buttons in this sequence from the log-in screen:

create a new account > create my account.

Both the Word and Ball game should be fully functional and display the results in a seperate screen at the end.
After the game ends, the user can exit the game by tapping the exit button on the top left corner of the screen.
As the log-out button in the settings still doesn't work, the user will need to restart the app to re-login.

In order to access a caretaker's view, tap the log-in button on the login screen.
In this version, all the names and the graphs presented after choosing a player are simply placeholders.
As the log-out button in the settings still doesn't work, the user will need to restart the app to re-login.



For Version III:

All features that can be accessed should be fully functional.

To access the player view, use the following credentials:

Email: p1@gmail.com

Password: Qwer123!

Minimal changes were made in the player's view from version II, the settings page now contain 
the version of the app and had the notification option removed as we did not implement it.

To access the caregiver view, use the following credentials:

Email: cc@gmail.com

Password: Qwer123!

Data visualization has been completed, after adding a user (ex. p1@gmail.com), 
a performance over time graph will be displayed along with a linear trend.

If desired, you are also able to create your own account(s) for testing.




Hope you have fun!
